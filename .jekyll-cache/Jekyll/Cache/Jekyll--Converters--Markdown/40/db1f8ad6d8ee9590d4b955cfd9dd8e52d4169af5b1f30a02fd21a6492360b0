Well, thatâ€™s exactly what Nepenthes is. These climbing plants grow in tropical rainforests like those found in Borneo. They can easily grow up to fifteen metres high. (Donâ€™t worry, you wonâ€™t have to re-roof your house when you buy our Monkey Jars!)</strong></p>

<p class="present-before-paste">These tropical plants can also be found in the Netherlands and are grown in hot and humid greenhouses around the country. Monkey Jars spend two years in a greenhouse before they are available in shops. They can easily survive and thrive in the average living room, especially if you give them a generous watering.</p>

<p class="present-before-paste">To put it simply, Monkey Jars are extremely cool houseplants. Take a look at it for a second: itâ€™s a brutal, carnivorous plant that can devour insects raw. Monkey Jars are available in two varieties: as a hanging plant and as a standing floor plant. The floor plant variety has a built-in water reservoir.</p>
