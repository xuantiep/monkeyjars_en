I"Ó<p>You probably already know that I hate it when my roots are dry. Iâ€™m happiest when you keep my roots damp by adding small amounts of water. Normally, Iâ€™ll be quite happy if you water me with a watering can twice a week when I am indoors. But that really depends on the situation. Watering me twice a week might be just too much or just not enough. So make sure to check that my soil is always damp. If it is a little dry, I would love another sip of water!</p>
